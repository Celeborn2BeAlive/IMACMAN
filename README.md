# IMACMAN

IMACMAN is a 3D game made in .cpp with OpenGL3 by a group of 3 IMAC Students

## COMPILATION

To compile, create a "Build" folder next to the "Code" folder.

Open the console inside of this new folder and write :


```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Davdouv/IMACMAN.git
$ cmake ../Code && make
$ ./IMACMAN_src/IMACMAN_NAME_OF_SRC_FILE
```



## CODING

The main file is in the folder Code/IMACMAN_src
All other files that you include in your main must be placed in :
- glimac/src/project for .cpp files
- glimac/include/project for .hpp files
- assets for all assets files (.png, .mp3, .obj etc...)
